        This guy begining to climb indoor at the age of 10. Then he started to climb outside but with a rope first. <br/>
        Later, he started the free solo climbing which is very scary. it needs a lot of mental and physical preparations.<br/>
        His biggest success is the climbing of the Cap (the 3000 feet vertical cliff which he is talking about). The Cap is just the longest cliff in the world.</p>

        Big data appears because the systems of communication grow every time. So, we had to create some thing, a method, a technology to deal with all this data. <br/>
        Big data is not always a good thing, in fact it creates a lot of activities on the network and so we have to implemant new data server and so we need more consommations. <br/>
        But, it has some good advantages: it allows a big organisation and sum up a big quantity of data and make a conclusion if it. </p>

        In this video, the "teacher" show an example of recursion using the programmation langage: Python. He tried to resolve the famous problem (Hanoi Tour) using it. <br/>
        The person explains that we always need to have a base case because, if we have not, it will create a loop to infinity and so the program will never work. <br/>
        He shows too that the recursion is nice because it doesn't take a lot of code and so whatever the langage you use. </p>

        In fact, he explains first what is an injection. An injection is easy to understand: imagine you have a web site with a database. In this database, you have informations about your clients, prices, products, ..., whatever. To put this informations in your database
        you have to make some queries and then execute it. Ok ? Well, an injection is a query that is send by someone (a villain) in order to modify your database. That all. <br/>

        He points out the fact that we always work and take care of our physical and not on the psychological aspect. He gives some examples about stories in which our emotions take the foot on everything. He encourages people working their emotionals habits and change it. <br/>
        He opens a door because we don't think about that and even if we think about, we don't know how to deal with it. <br/>
        For instance: when someone tell you that you're a piece of shit, a internal voice says to you that it is true and I'm a piece of shit. BUT you don't have and you shouldn't have to do this to you ! <br/>

        We are surrounded by screens and we are all the times looking at them. The problem with is that we have a level of simulation that is very high.

        <p><b style="font-size: 24px;">S</b>ummary: in this video, the teacher try to show us a proof of a complicated problem. In fact, this is a pure logic question that have a strange answer. He tried to find if a statement is true or false but he used contradictions.<br/>
        This is a common trick in maths. For instance, if I want to prove that I'm not a cat: I can first suppose that I'm a cat. Then, someone turn off the light. I see nothing. But if I was really a cat I could see. So there is a contradiction and it implies that the assemption "I'm a cat" is false, so I'm not a cat. <br/>
        In fact, the teacher used the famous programation langages Python to demonstrate this. He used differents functions and explained how it can work. I think that I don't have to explain this here ... </p>

The algorithm is very simple to understand: it mixes the input of data and put
          it in the output. The encryption is done because we can't guess the message with the code in output. The complexity of the encryption lie in the fact that the previous algorithm is repeated a very big big number of time and with a lot of data. </p>

        First, I decided to make a short presentation of the history of the brainstorming and then present the subject of the brainstorming. We work together during ten minutes on a bike I wanted to design. There were some constraint on this bike: have a screen, be waterproof, confortable. The students participate because I give them (totaly randomly) the floor. It was a success for me because I could talk with a good interaction with the other student.</p>

        Have a good vocabulary plus make correct sentences plus have a correct accent is something I have to work :)</p>

        In fact, some people anticipated this. It did 5 years that google was loosing money on this service because they were using a lot of servers and it was free for the users. It was just a big BIG finance technic to attract all the people to their "free" services. In fact it was juste a ******* trap.<br/>
        Now, given that google has the monopol, they can use the pression on people and limit them. The poor users will be forced to pay if they want to keep their photos on the web (beyond 15 GB). <br/>
        Google is very critised for this (and I really do it to!). It was just a giant economic trap... The only thing that is good is that they will use less servers and so less energie and it will contaminate less. </p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 24px;">V</b>ocabulary: Disgruntled (mécontent), downgrade (rétrograder), spokesperson (porte-parole), like-minded (qui partage les mêmes idées/valeurs/goûts), unfathomable (insondable), unrelenting (incessant)</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 24px;">R</b>eflexions: I didn't find the article easy. It was a little bit difficult but I learned new words so it is very nice. I feel that I really need to read english article/text to familiarize me to a rich english vocabulary. </p>

    <h4><b>About Me</b></h4>
    <p>Hi ! My name is Matthias ROUYER and I am a student in BAC+3 at ESISAR, a computer science ingenieer french pulblic school. I'm 20 years hold and I loved the apple pies. <br/><br/>
    For an english exam, I decided to create a website as an information carrier. The instructions was the following: <br/>
    We had to choose three or more themes that reflect our weeknesses in english and make a portfolio with the elements that contributed to improve them. </p>
    <p>I decided to choose: 1) oral comprehension, 2) oral expression and 3) the vocabulary of the daily life.<br/>
    You can see just below my "progression" with the bars threw the months. They represent the pourcentage of my capacities in each theme. I tried to make it graphical so I could see my progression.  </p>
    <p>There were two reasons why I choose to make a website instead of making a simple PowerPoint or simple document </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Firstly, I found that it was disruptive and cool to present this with a website. Moreover, we see a lot of portfolio on the web and I was really inspired.</li>
      <li>Secondly, I have some knowledge with the creation of website and I make website for professional companies with my micro-company. So, this portfolio is an auto-ad of what I can do.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p>* All the videos I watched were in a quality of 480p maximum in order to limit my impact on the web.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>To conclude, I can say that reading, watching, listening all the contents and forcing myself to capture the new vocabularies and making summaries helps myself a lot. <br/>
      I think that I really improved myself in english and particulary in oral comprehension. </p>
    </p>Given that I did writen summaries on every content I came across, I can say that it improved my writting skills too. So, I can say that I worked on four themes. <br/>
    It was a good experience and I learned a lot of new things ! :)</p>
